    <h1>Martha's Jollof Rice Recipe</h1>

<h2>About</h2>
    <p>Jollof , or jollof rice, is a rice dish from West Africa. The dish is typically made with long-grain rice, tomatoes, onions, spices, vegetables and meat in a single pot, although its ingredients and preparation methods vary across different region.
        <p>The origin story of jollof rice is one origin story close to my heart, because it truly speaks of the connection between West African cuisine and modern-day Southern "red" cuisine. It originated in modern day Senegal, from the Wollof people. <br> As Portuguese trading posts were set up on the Senegal River Delta, tomatoes made their way to West Africa.

It's commonly believed that a shortage of barley led a local cook to use rice, and modern-day jollof rice was born (called Benachin, aka, one pot).
<br> One school of thought suggests that the influence of jollof rice has been felt in the American South, where West African slaves from rice-growing regions introduced the "red rice" concept. Modern-day dishes like jambalaya and gumbo are believed to derive some influence from jollof rice!</p>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the following, adding each to the blender as you complete it: Coarsely chop 1/2 large red onion, peel 1-inch piece ginger and coarsely chop (about 1 tablespoon), trim the stem from 1/2 to 1 habanero pepper, add 5 garlic cloves and blend on high speed until smooth, about 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Pour the mixture into a medium saucepan and bring to a boil over medium heat. Continue to cook, stirring occasionally, for 15 minutes. The mixture will thicken slightly and turn bright red.</li>
        <li>Thinly slice 1/2 large red onion. Place 4 cups long-grain white rice in a fine-mesh strainer and rinse thoroughly under cool running water. Set aside to drain.</li>
        <li>Heat 1/2 cup vegetable oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium heat until shimmering. Add the onions and cook until translucent, 4 to 5 minutes. Add 3 tablespoons tomato paste, 1 tablespoon kosher salt, 2 teaspoons curry powder, 4 fresh thyme sprigs or 1 teaspoon dried thyme, 1 teaspoon ground white pepper, and 2 bay leaves. Stir and cook until the paste has darkened in color, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Pour in the red pepper base and 3 cups stock. Stir to combine and bring to a simmer. Continue to cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, for 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the rice and stir until combined. Reduce the heat to low and cover the pot with aluminum foil and then the lid. Cook undisturbed for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove the lid and foil and gently fluff the rice. Remove and discard the bay leaves and thyme sprigs. If the rice tastes a bit undercooked, remove from the heat, cover again, and let sit for 10 minutes. Don’t worry if the rice burns a bit at the bottom of the pot. This is part of what contributes a smoky flavor to the dish, and some people actually prefer this part! Taste and season the rice with more kosher salt as needed.</li>
